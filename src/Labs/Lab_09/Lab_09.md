**OVERLOAD CONSTRUCTORS**

Modify Lab 05:

Overload the constructors, besides the default constructor, create one that takes two doubles.

Then overload the method that calculates the distance, besides accepting four doubles, add instance methods that accept an airport as argument,  and another that will simply take two doubles representing a latitude and longitude. Do not copy and paste the formula in the static method onto the overloaded methods. If you copy/paste code more than 2 or 3 lines, then your program needs to be re-written. Instead, simply call the "base" method.

Remember the class Airport doesn't talk to the user. Therefore, you should have a separate class if you want to test the results.
