For this project you will modify an existing project, click on the files to download the VideoGame.zip file.

This is an introduction to a video game. The existing project contains two files. In the two files there are two public and one private class.

If you run the current program you will see the cyan dots (stars) fall down at different speeds.

Once you have been able to download the zip file, decompress it, and compile it, you will modify it as follows:

There is a private class for the KeyListener interface, using that interface

1) Create the methods moveUp, moveLeft, moveRight in the Star class.

2) Change the direction of the stars when the user hits any arrows on the keyboard.

Extra credit 5 points: When the user changes direction of the stars, play a small mdi file. In other words, add sound.
