**FLIGHT ITINERARY**

For this project, you will create an array of airports. <br/>
You will ask the user how many legs this itinerary has and what is the Ground Speed , then the number of airports to ask will be one plus the number of legs. For example, if the user enters two legs, then you will ask the user information about Airport 1, Airport 2 and Airport 3. Then you will calculate the distance for each leg, that is the distance between Airport 1 and Airport 2 and the total flight time, then the distance between Airport 2 and airport 3, and it's total flight time. Finally, you will print out the itinerary with the distance and flight times, for example, if the user entered 2 legs at a speed of 300 mph (it's actually knots), you will ask for the information of the three airport, then display the itinerary like this:

| Leg   | From | To  | Dist | Time (mins) |
|-------|------|-----|------|-------------|
| 1     | SAN  | LAX | 95   | 19          |
| 2     | LAX  | SFO | 293  | 59          |
| Total |      |     | 388  | 78          |
